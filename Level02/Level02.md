Get into level 02 also just like level01, "ssh
[[level02\@io.netgarage.org]{.underline}](mailto:level02@io.netgarage.org)["
and input it's password which is founded from the level01.]()

Level02 files also inside the "/levels/" location.

There is "level02" file. We can check that file using "file" command.

After run that file they have given us a message.

They said "source code is available in level02.c". Let's view source
code using level02.c file.

There is a function called "catcher()". And also that function has one
parameter and that parameter not should be zero. Since the catcher will
only run on signal SIGFPE. Then let's check the man page of signal(2).

"According to POSIX, the behavior of a process is undefined after it
ignores a SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV signal that was not generated by
kill(2) or raise(3). Integer division by zero has undefined result. On
some architectures it will generate a SIGFPE signal. (Also dividing the
most negative integer by -1 may generate SIGFPE.) Ignoring this signal
might lead to an endless loop."

The most negative integer would either be -2\^15 (2 bytes) or -2\^31 (4
bytes) and this is a 32bit system. Lets try with 4 bytes.

Great!! you have level shell now. Then try to view "/home/level3/.pass".

Congratulations!!! now you have password to the level03. And thank you
all see you on next time with level03 walkthrough.
